 Strange Game
==================

• We take turns picking numbers from 1 to 9.

• The same number can't be chosen twice.

• First player to hold 3 numbers which, when added, make 15, wins.

• If all numbers are exhausted without a winner, the game is a tie.

• We will play 15 rounds of this game, alternating who goes first.

• Win or tie all 15 rounds, and I'll give you the flag.
